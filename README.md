# edda-bot
This project was created to help new players in the game Legend of Edda: Pegasus. The BOT will be responsible for answering players' questions quickly, practically, and directly.

Currently, this bot directs players to the official website and the shop. It also directs players to support, which consists of opening a ticket so that staff can resolve potential issues and answer questions. The bot was created to assist staff, thus reducing the number of tickets received daily and helping new players (with some custom commands, programmed in python).
